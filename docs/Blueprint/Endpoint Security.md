Note: Threat stream will contain alerts raised from endpoint devices

Rest of the streams will contain: log that shows the user-generated activity that is performed through the console or the API

Streams - Authentication, IAM and Configuration - Will be used only if Audit logs are present in the same server, and not if the logs are generated in a management server. This decision will be taken based on each device. - - common ground required needs discussion
